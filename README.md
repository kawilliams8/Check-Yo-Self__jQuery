## Learning Goals
During the Mod1/Mod2 intermission, students were challenged to refactor a project using functionality that will be taught in Mod 2. Specific instructions were to focus on jQuery, DRYing up code, replacing for loops with .forEach(), using switch statements where necessary, rewrite ES5 functions into ES6 arrow functions, and install ESLint.
